So there I was, minding my own business, eating my apfelkuchen.
Out of nowhere, a man wearing lederhose approached me.
"Have you seen a black hund around here by any chance?" He said.
"I did see one, although it was in Berlin... or perhaps was it Raesfeld? I can never tell them apart", I answered.
This answer was not what I expected so I continued on my way to the Biergarten listening to Rammstein's Deutchland.
While enjoying a beverage, I looked across the street and saw the black hund I was searching for driving a Porche!
"You and your leaderhose friend will never get me!" He barked. "Quick, get in my brand new badass BMW" the stranger I had just met told me after pulling over just in front of me.
It was at that moment that I realized how wettbewerbsfaehig my new acquaintance was, as we immediately engaged in a white-knuckle clash of classy cars.
Despite our belligerent start, we found friendship in an unlikely place, and after a few too many celebratory drinks we went to a small doener shop in a random alley.
I woke up in the morning on the bench in front of my house, realizing I didn't find the Schloss of my front door last night after so many drinks, and I had a bad dreams about a black hund driving a Porsche.
